Kinder garden register (with validation for admin and correct input info) testing with Cucumber scenarios. The admin can create, delete, edit kid data name, number, group. Kids have data if they are disabled, have siblings in the kindergarten, and they can collect points from these things. Kids are sorted by points in the groups. Parents have a username, password, and user type; they can add or delete kids. Testing is: 1. The user opens the login screen. 2. They insert a valid name and password. 3. Click on the login button. 4. See a message for success, or problem. 5. And many other steps.
