This app is for registering kids in kindergarten and testing the app with Cucumber using scenarios. Other details are that the app has an admin who can create, delete kids, and add kids' names and numbers to groups. Every kid has additional details like if they are disabled, have siblings in the kindergarten or not, and they can collect points from these things. The kids in the groups are sorted by points, and every group is named with a letter. Parents have a username, password, and user type; they can add or delete kids. The app also has validation for correct usernames and passwords and checks if the user is an admin.
